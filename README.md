# Value proporsition

## Customer target

Medium to big companies on sectors that requires the adquisition of information from clients, stakeholders or internally via forms. For example banks or financial institutions in general which periodically need to collect information from their clients.

## Problem solving

This kind of companies fall into a trap when they try to use form generators for large projects. The currently avaible solutions doesn't follow the standad procedures of dealing with code or infrastructure like version control, different environments for developping or creation thorugh code instead of tediouse interfaces and verboses and bad design ways of creation the forms through API calls if possible at all.

Also this kind of companies often run a into situation where they need their forms to be authenticated and that is not covered by any solution known. Another thing not easy on the solutions explore is the branding, letting the customers design their forms have their own branding.

## What we offer

With this problems in mind, we want to offer as a first version an API with DSL deisgn in which with one API call you can send a request to the backend with the form you want coded on the request and the API will return a link to the self-hosted form. In this way we solve all problems exposed above. As everything is defined in plain text developers from those companies can leverage on standard version control like git, they can include the deployment of production or development versions on their CDs and they don't have to deal with a tedious interface or clunky APIs.

Our forms are going to be completly customizables so they can make their own branding and authentication this first version is going to be handled through magic links.

## Monetaization

- One proposal for monetaization could be selling the access to the API itself.
